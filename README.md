# Payout Management Service

This project implements a small payout management API using **Django 4.2**, **Django REST Framework**, and **Celery**
for
asynchronous processing. It is designed as a demonstration of clean, production-style backend practices with modern
Python tooling.

At this stage, the repository contains the initial project scaffolding and Poetry configuration. The full behaviour,
including the `Payout` model, Celery tasks, and API endpoints, will be implemented in later steps.

## Getting Started (Work in Progress)

1. Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed.
2. Install Poetry (if not already available):

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

Further setup instructions (Django project creation, settings, Celery configuration, Docker, and tests) will be added as
the corresponding implementation steps are completed.
